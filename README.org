* Introduction
  This is yet another build tool. The idea of this tool is to be a generic
  language agnostic build and task runner system with zero dependencies other
  that an operating system and a bash shell.

  Basically start by defining a tool, which defines how it gets installed and
  used. Then define a task that uses this tool to run.
